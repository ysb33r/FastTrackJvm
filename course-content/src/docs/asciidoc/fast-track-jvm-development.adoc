=== JDK Installation

A JDK needs to be installed and `JAVA_HOME` needs to be set in the environment. We assume that you know how to set
environmental variables for your operating system. If you do not have a JDK installed, it van be done via hte local
package manager or downloaded from the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle website].
Please ensure that you have a JDK installed and not just a JRE.

.Why Gradle
* Very modern, next-generation build & deployment pipeline tool
* DSL is based on Groovy
* Vast collection of plugins
* Make it easy to integrate development and complex testing
* Deploy local & to remote sites via plugins
* Use Docker local & remote
* "I do not have means to test on my machine" becomes less of an argument.


.Example buildscript for testing
[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin : 'groovy'

repositories {
  jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    testCompile 'org.spockframework:spock-core:1.0-groovy-2.4'

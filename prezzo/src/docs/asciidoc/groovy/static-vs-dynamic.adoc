=== Static vs Dynamic

* By default code in Groovy is compiled with dynamic typing.
* Typing can be modifed by selective application of annotations:
** `@CompileStatic` - compile static typing
** `@CompileDynamic` - compile dynamic typing
** `@TypeChecked` - compile dynamic, but check types
* Apply to classes & methods.

=== Is Groovy Slower than Java?

* Yes and No.
* Context is critical
** Russell Winder has done number of experiments
* JSON parsing in Groovy is faster than Java.
* Develop first, measure, then optimise!
** Remember C++ -> C -> Assembler optimisation?
